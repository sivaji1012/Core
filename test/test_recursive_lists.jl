# test/test_recursive_lists.jl
#
# Standalone probe — NOT included in runtests.jl yet.
# Proves the list-library rewrite (single guarded clauses + `if`) terminates
# and fires, where main's ($h . $t) cons-pattern stdlib does not.
#
# Run:  julia --project=packages/Core packages/Core/test/test_recursive_lists.jl
#
# Expected against MAIN:   RED — list ops return unreduced; `is-function`
#                          over-produces.
# Expected against REWRITE: GREEN — all terminate and reduce.
#
# Each @test is annotated with its audit bin so a failure is self-describing.
