# AC8 Phase-2 — task generator + the two PRE-BUILD vacuity proofs (synergy gate §5.1, §5.4).
# Spec: ../../docs/actpc/AC8_synergy_gate.md. Before ANY coupled run we must prove the task
# is non-vacuous, i.e.:
#   §5.4  the confound is REAL: on the confound subset, a WRONG (rule, drift) explains the
#         observation exactly as well as the truth — rule and channel are mutually
#         unidentifiable from a single half.
#   §5.1  the barrier is INFORMATION-theoretic, not capacity: because two DIFFERENT symbol
#         tracks produce IDENTICAL observations, NO map observation→symbol (any capacity)
#         can be correct on the confound family. Capacity cannot help.
# And we check the disambiguating information EXISTS (so the gate is feasible, not impossible):
#   over long horizons the discrete rule WRAPS (mod K) but the continuous drift does not, so
#   the joint sawtooth+ramp separates δ from b — recoverable only by using BOTH halves.
#
# Pure Julia (LinearAlgebra + Statistics) — the proofs are geometric/analytic, no neural deps.
# Construction: proto[s] = s·u (collinear along unit u ∈ R^D); drift = b·(t−1)·u (SAME u, the
# confound direction). Scalar observable x_t = ⟨y_t,u⟩ = (s0+(t−1)δ mod K) + b(t−1).
# No-wrap regime ⇒ x_t = s0 + (t−1)(δ+b): only the SUM δ+b is observable.
