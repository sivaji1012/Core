# AC8 Phase-2 — synergy gate S1/S2/S3 (pure-Julia mechanism validation; spec §4, §6).
# Spec: ../../docs/actpc/AC8_synergy_gate.md. Step 1 (ac8_phase2_task.jl) PROVED the task is
# non-vacuous. This builds the four conditions and evaluates the capability gate.
#
# FAITHFUL FORMULATION (the key design realization): in the pure no-wrap regime the confound is
# EXACT even for the coupled system — there is no information to separate rule-step δ from
# drift-rate b. The disambiguating signal is the mod-K WRAP, which must be PRESENT in training.
# The synergy is that only JOINT inference over (δ,b) can exploit the wrap; each CONSTRAINED
# single half cannot:
#   coupled        = joint argmin over (δ,b)        — the bridge's de-drift↔induce realizes this
#   symbolic-alone = argmin over δ with b=0         — drift-blind (can't subtract the ramp)
#   neural-alone   = argmin over b with δ=0         — rule-blind (no discrete rule to roll out)
#   parallel-uncpl = neural picks b (δ=0), THEN symbolic picks δ given that b — one-shot, no bridge
# Disambiguator = reconstruction residual on training that INCLUDES wraps. Capability metric =
# held-out track accuracy (roll out ŝ_t=(s0+(t-1)δ̂) mod K from the seed) on UNSEEN seeds +
# extrapolation horizon. (The grid search is the joint-inference IDEAL the PC bridge approximates;
# the FabricPC + real-soup realization is the next, heavier leg.)

# RESULT (2026-06-10) — HONEST NEGATIVE. The gate FAILS on this (linear-drift) task:
#   coupled (1,2) acc 1.00 | symbolic-only (1,0) acc 1.00 | neural-only (0,2) acc 0.03 |
#   parallel-uncoupled (1,2) acc 1.00   ⇒ S1=S2=false (only neural-alone fails).
#
# ROOT CAUSE: a LINEAR drift makes the disambiguating mod-K wrap TOO accessible. The
# drift-blind symbolic search (b=0) still recovers δ=1, because mis-locating a wrap costs
# ≈K² in residual — one sharp signal that dominates the unexplained linear ramp. So a
# CONSTRAINED single half nails the rule WITHOUT the bridge, and parallel-uncoupled also
# succeeds (neural's b̂ is coincidentally right). The task is too linear to ISOLATE synergy;
# the synergy regime is a knife-edge (tuning wrap-vs-confound weight), which would violate
# the gate's robustness spirit. NOT tuned to a fake pass (discipline: honest negative).
#
# IMPLICATION (drives the next leg): robust synergy needs a drift the single halves CANNOT
# marginalize — i.e. NONLINEAR / stochastic drift (a random-walk or context-nonlinear channel)
# that defeats any constrained global fit, yet that a real NEURAL net CAN regress GIVEN the
# rule's proto-baseline predictions. That genuinely requires the FabricPC neural half (a grid
# search cannot represent a flexible drift) + the real ActPC-Chem soup. So step-2b = richer
# (nonlinear-drift) task + FabricPC + soup. This pure-Julia harness has served its purpose:
# it falsified the simplest task design BEFORE the expensive build. See AC8_synergy_gate.md.
