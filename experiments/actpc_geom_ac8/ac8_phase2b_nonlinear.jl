# AC8 Phase-2b — STATE-DEPENDENT (path-integral) drift: does the entanglement create synergy?
# Spec ../../docs/actpc/AC8_synergy_gate.md §9. Step-2a falsified the LINEAR-drift task (the
# drift-blind single half recovered the rule from the wrap). Implication: the drift must be
# something a constrained single fit CANNOT marginalize but that requires the symbol track to
# estimate. Construction here: the continuous channel is the PATH INTEGRAL of a per-symbol
# increment — z_t = Σ_{τ<t} φ(s_τ) — so z_t depends on the whole symbol HISTORY. Observable
# x_t = ⟨y_t,u⟩ = s_t + z_t (drift along the proto line u, corrupting). To remove z you need
# the track (the rule); to get the track you need z removed. Chicken-egg.
#
# Conditions (profiled-joint = the bridge's joint-inference ideal, deterministic):
#   coupled        = argmin_δ over [φ profiled out: φ̂=lstsq(F(track_δ), x−s_δ)]   (joint δ,φ)
#   symbolic-only  = argmin_δ with φ=0                                           (drift-blind)
#   neural-only    = δ=0 (no rule ⇒ const track) ⇒ φ̂ degenerates to a t-trend   (rule-blind)
#   parallel-uncpl = neural's ẑ (δ=0) subtracted, THEN symbolic picks δ once     (no bridge)
# Capability metric = held-out track accuracy (roll out the induced δ̂ from each seed).
# HONEST: if symbolic-only STILL recovers δ, that's evidence a grid/lstsq harness is too
# powerful to isolate synergy ⇒ the real modality-limited substrates (FabricPC + soup) are
# required. We TEST it, we don't assume it.

# RESULT (2026-06-10) — PARTIAL POSITIVE. Path-integral drift z_t=Σ_{τ<t}φ(s_τ) (the channel
# is the accumulation of a per-symbol increment ⇒ estimating it REQUIRES the symbol track).
# Modality-faithful single halves: symbolic = discrete tokens (round→induce, drift-corrupted);
# neural = continuous regression only, NO rule (cubic-in-t de-drift). coupled = joint-inference
# IDEAL (continuous precision FROM neural + rule FROM soup). Sweep over drift scale:
#   scale 0.5–1: symbolic STILL recovers δ (small zero-mean φ ⇒ modal step = δ). No gap.
#   scale ≥ 2  : S1 HOLDS ROBUSTLY — coupled 1.00 vs symbolic 0.13 (≈chance), neural 0.12.
#                Large drift destroys the discrete modal-step heuristic; only the continuous
#                JOINT fit recovers δ (and corr(φ̂,φ0)=1.0 — it also recovers the drift law).
#   S2 NOT clean: parallel-uncoupled (cubic-in-t neural de-drift, one-shot) recovers δ by LUCK
#                 at some scales (3,6). The cubic is a poor neural proxy ⇒ S2 is inconclusive here.
#
# CONCLUSION: the redesigned task produces GENUINE S1 capability synergy (coupled ≫ both
# modality-limited singles), robustly for drift scale ≥ 2 — this validates the task. S2
# (synergy = error-EXCHANGE, not ensembling) specifically needs the REAL FabricPC PC neural
# half: its de-drift is principled, so parallel-uncoupled fails STRUCTURALLY (no rule ⇒ no
# proto-baseline ⇒ can't isolate the path-drift), not coincidentally. → Step 2b-real =
# FabricPC PC neural half + real ActPC-Chem soup on THIS task; settle S2 + realize the bridge.
