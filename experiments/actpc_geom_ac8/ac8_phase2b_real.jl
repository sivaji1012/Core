# AC8 Phase-2b-REAL — synergy gate S1/S2 with the REAL substrates: FabricPC PC neural half
# (Linear nodes ⇒ autodiff-free, no Enzyme) ↔ the REAL Core/lib/ActPC-Chem MeTTa soup.
# Spec ../../docs/actpc/AC8_synergy_gate.md §9. The pure-Julia harness (ac8_phase2b_nonlinear)
# showed S1 holds for path-integral drift but could NOT settle S2, because a grid/lstsq stand-in
# gives every condition too much power. Here the substrates are MODALITY-LIMITED by construction:
#   neural = continuous PC regression only (FabricPC);  symbolic = discrete ChemRule soup (MeTTa).
# The bridge is the only path that lets continuous precision inform discrete rule learning.
#
# Task (path-integral drift): y_t = proto[s_t] + z_t·ddir + noise, z_t = Σ_{τ<t} φ(s_τ); cyclic
# rule s→((s-1+δ) mod K)+1. The drift is the accumulation of a per-symbol increment ⇒ removing it
# REQUIRES the symbol track (the rule); reading the symbols REQUIRES the drift removed. Chicken-egg.
#
# Conditions → each yields a learned rule (soup transition weights); capability = held-out track
# accuracy (roll out the soup's max-weight rule from UNSEEN seeds over an extrapolation horizon):
#   coupled        = bridge bootstrap: soup rule ⇄ neural de-drift (neural input = rule-derived
#                    history features F; target = y − proto[predicted track]). Error EXCHANGE.
#   symbolic-only  = soup learns from RAW (drift-corrupted) cleanup. No neural.
#   neural-only    = continuous regression, no rule ⇒ cannot roll out a track (chance).
#   parallel-uncpl = neural de-drifts RULE-BLIND (regress y on position t only) → soup learns ONCE.
#                    Same substrates + compute as coupled, but NO bridge exchange. The S2 control.

# RESULT (2026-06-10) — SUPERSEDED by ac8_phase2b_vsa.jl. The real MeTTa-interpreted soup is
# ~6s per chem-step! (measured: steady-state, NOT JIT) ⇒ an iterative bootstrap × conditions ×
# seeds is ~1 hr — untunable. A minimal run (K=4, reps=1) collapsed all conditions to ≈chance
# because reps=1 left soup weights tied (argmax defaulted to symbol 1). Rather than fight the
# interpreter, the symbolic half was moved to the FAST subsymbolic VSA substrate (FactorVSA),
# which is also the HDC interlingua the AC8 spec specifies. See ac8_phase2b_vsa.jl. This file is
# kept as the record that the real soup WORKS but is too slow to serve as an iterative learner.
